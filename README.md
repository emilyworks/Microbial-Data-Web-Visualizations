This excercise involved sorting and organizing mass amounts of data on samples of bellybutton microbes to create interactive dashboard plots detailing the frequencies of different microbes per sample (i.e., per person). The demographic information and plots change depending on the person/sample selected in the dropdown list on the webpage, and hovering over the content of graphs will produce additional information on the names of the microbes in every sample value.
